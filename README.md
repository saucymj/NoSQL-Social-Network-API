# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description

In this project I created a backend social media site using NoSql database. I wanted to use a new package of `mongoose` so that the server can handle large amounts of unstructured data. It solves the problem of a company having to use a databse that only allows so much to go on. I learned that mongoose is a much more lenient when it comes to adding and attatching data to one another (ORM).

## Installation

I had to first install `mongoose` and `express` since it is not a live site.

## Usage

A company would be able to use my database if the wanted to create a new social media app that allows users to add friends, make post, react to post, and even delete all things they would add.
